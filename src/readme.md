Summary:

1. Age Group Analysis
[!Age Distribution Plot](images/Figure_1.png)
Most Common Age Group:
Using the age distribution plot (histogram), we can observe which age range has the highest frequency.
Typically, customers in their 30s and 40s tend to dominate in such datasets.
Interpretation:
The most common age group (peak in the histogram) represents the bank's target demographic. This group can guide marketing and retention strategies.

2. Differences in Balances or Tenure Across Genders
Balances Across Genders:

Interpretation:
Gender-wise analysis helps the bank understand if certain products or services appeal more to one gender. For instance:
Higher average balances for one gender might suggest higher-value customers.
Longer tenures for one gender could indicate stronger loyalty.



Insights from Exploratory Data Analysis
Age Distribution:

The most common age group is 
[!Age Distribution Plot](images/Figure_1.png)
indicating a primary demographic for the bank.
Younger customers (below 25) and older customers (above 60) are less frequent.
Gender-wise Balance and Tenure:

Median balances are slightly higher for [insert gender with higher median], but variability exists across both groups.
Tenure is fairly similar across genders, suggesting balanced customer loyalty.
Correlation Analysis:

Strongest correlations observed:
CreditScore has a positive correlation with churn.
Customers with lower balances are more likely to churn, especially those with zero balances.
